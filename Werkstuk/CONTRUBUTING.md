## How to contribute

### Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in discussions.

### Issues
  
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you spot a problem with the docs or something in the content that should be updated, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

Solving an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull request

A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
